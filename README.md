Basically done:
1. Communications (username, connect, join room, send line, like/unlike line)
2. Partition tolerance.

Problems:
1. Too many logs - we are still debugging this.
2. BUG with join room. If join room A then join room B then join A again, problem begins.
3. Design doc is not the lastest. We are combining our docs together to hand in a new one asap.
